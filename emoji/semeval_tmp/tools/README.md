# Tools for Semeval2018 Task2 - Multilanguage Emoji Prediction

------- STILL NOT READY :sob: -----------

Come back the 18 Sep 2018, when we release the training set.

We will provide:

* An evaluation script
* A crawler to download the training set (as we will provide only the tweet IDs) 
* An emoji extractor, to extract the emojis from a tweet, and use them as labels (with correct mapping of the emojis used in the task)
